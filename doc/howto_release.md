# How to release a node-realsense build
Go to [Setup Environment](./setup_environment.md) first to ensure all your hardware and software are ready.

## Preparation
1. Follow [Generating an SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/) and add this SSH key to your github account. If you ever did that, please bypass this step.
2. Get push permission for this repo. (Because we need bump the patch version automatically)
3. Setup the night build archive server, typically HTTP server running on that. Apply an user account with permission to write to the www directory.
4. Add your ssh key (on step 1) to archive server, follow [Adding SSH Keys to authorized_keys](http://askubuntu.com/questions/46424/adding-ssh-keys-to-authorized-keys). This step ensure you can push code and upload to archive server w/o password.

## Customize
1. clone this code via SSH way, `git clone git@github.com:otcshare/node-realsense.git`. Otherwise, unable to automatically push commit.
2. Copy `tools/.boto_config.json.template` to `tools/.boto_config.json` and change the value
```
  "archive_server": {
    "host": "<your_archive_server>",
    "nightly_dir": "", # The directory of nightly build
    "official_dir": "", # The directory of official build
    "usergroup": "", # group on archive server
    "username": "" # username on archive server
  },
  "build_type": "nightly", # Support nightly or official type
  "bump_version": true, # Whether to bump version
  "tarball_only": false, # Only make tarball, no install and test
  "upload_build": true # Whether to upload build to server
```
3. Copy `tools/.no_password.expect.template` to `tools/.no_password.expect` and change the right value. NOTE, please keep this file carefully because it contains your passpharse to unlock the SSH key (step1).
4. Install required packages `sudo apt-get install expect`

## Run Build
### Nightly
Ensure `build_type` is ***nightly*** in `tools/.boto_config.json` and execute `tools/build_realsense_js.sh`. Some hints:

* Add it to cronjob via `crontab -e`. For example (run every day at 10pm):
```
0 22 * * * cd $HOME/nightly/node-realsense/tools/build_realsense_js.sh
```
* `bump_version` is normally set as ***true*** to automatic bump the patch version.
* `tarball_only` can be set as ***false*** to allow npm install and test run.
* `upload_build` is mostly ***true***.

## Official
Ensure `build_type` is ***official*** in `tools/.boto_config.json` and execute `tools/build_realsense_js.sh <version>`. Some hints:

* `bump_version` is ***true*** will auto make tagging and push commit. If you want to the bump commit review by pull request, set `bump_version` as ***false***, then you need follow normal PR review process.
* `tarball_only` can be set as ***true*** to save time.
* `upload_build` is mostly ***true***.

## Check build
There will be `node_realsense-<date>.log` after each run. The tarball of each module and log file will eventually uploaded to the archive server. And the latest link will always point the latest nightly build.
